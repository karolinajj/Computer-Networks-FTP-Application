# Computer-Networks-FTP-Application

This project is divided into two main parts: the development of a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) application and the configuration of a network through a series of experiments.
- FTP Application - The first part of this project focuses on creating an application capable of downloading files from a specified source via the FTP protocol.
- Network Configuration - The second part of the project involves a series of experiments designed to configure a network. This includes tasks such as setting up an IP network, implementing bridges in switches, configuring routers (including a commercial router), implementing Network Address Translation (NAT), and managing topologies with various network connections.

Detailed documentation and the Network Configuration is available in the repository.
